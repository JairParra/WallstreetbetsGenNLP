"Institutions already know PCE data one month before you, and the Report is already priced in by the time it drops - here's your proof",161,1bqth2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqth2o/institutions_already_know_pce_data_one_month/,73,1711729631.0,"Too many lil dipshits telling me I'm crazy for having this theory, so I took the time to break it down for those mongoloids.

We do not see the PCE report for the prior month until the end of the current month. On March 29, we only just now see February's PCE, but it is the end of March, and that subsequent report will already be just about finished. Institutions get to see those numbers weeks before us.

Here's your proof:

From July 28, 2023 through October 27, 2023, SPY dropped -$40.

From June 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, PCE stopped declining and ramped up hot at 3.198% to 3.37% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))

Keep those dates in mind, and follow along with daddy:

From May 2023 through June 2023, PCE DROPPED 3.96% to 3.19%. The June DROPPED PCE rate would have released to the public on July 28, 2023. This is precisely when SPY began bleeding out. At that time the bleeding began, it would have looked to Retail as though PCE was still cooling. However, at the time June PCE was being released to the public, July data was already in existence, and the July data was going to show that PCE was no longer cooling, and in fact was rising again.

You still with me? Let's fast-forward to the most recent climb, which began on October 26, 2023, which has preceded this most recent vertical line up.

On October 27, 2023, Retail was just getting the released September PCE readings. ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01))

As you may recall, September's PCE readings were STILL GOING UP. On October 27, 2023, the public would still be seeing a rise in PCE. However, weirdly, the market began shooting up.

Guess why...

Because the October data showed PCE significantly cooled from 3.37% to 2.95% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))

Weirdly, this cooling data from October was not available to the public until November 30, 2023, at which point SPY had already rebounded from $410 to $450.

&#x200B;

That's all. This isn't a conspiracy you clowns, this is real.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr, SPY price movements correlate perfectly with UNRELEASED PCE data, and contradicts the released data.

NVDA to the moon?!?! Start of Q2,3,1bqw55v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqw55v/nvda_to_the_moon_start_of_q2/,3,1711736188.0,"Hey guys currently 2am in Singapore, i'm a 19 YO Finance student at a local institution and am ready to  print money in NVDA. Recently this week alone I deposited in about $800 SGD = $550ish USD on Tuesday and managed to get it to about $1500 USD which I'm insanely proud off.

When next Monday opens, I was initally thinking of shorting NVDA as I still believed its overpriced and might come down a lot, but recently I meant in the last 10 mins, I looked through 2023's Start of Q2, Q3 and Q4 and NVDA shot up a lot in the first day, as my strategy for options is no matter how long the DTE is i'll preferably sell the option on the same day to ensure theta dont ruin me.

So since only the only option that is avaible within my budget is a 1 week option of $1500 USD (Strike price of $895 current stock price is $902), y'all reckon following the trend is a good strategy as I predict that there will still be a sell off in the beginning then a $20 gain (Hopefully)

I know that this will essentially be my entire portfolio so fuck it right, im still young and my Finance teacher's been doubting my abilities to make a 10 baggers gotta prove him WRONG!!!

So a $20 gain in NVDA if i get a good entry price this will likely give me a 3.5x of my $1500, i'm not rich by any metrics and if done properly I'll donate $100 to the old people playing harmonica and selling tissues by the train stations promise, to the moon we GO!?!?!?

Looking at CVNA from rear view mirror, how did CVNA shares recover more than 20 times of net share value in one year?
