Right so here's the idea.

SGML, is Sigma Lithium. They just announced after earnings that they are looking to double production. Construction begins this month. They already have the capital required to get it built.

What do they make? EV batteries. Who drives places? Everybody. It's simple. Cars don't work without batteries. Tesla just got rocked by that Chinese company who is selling their cars cheaper. Maybe they've got a better battery supplier. Maybe it's SGML. Maybe not but who knows.

Either way, gains.

To recap:

- Being a sigma is fuckin cool

- Lithium

- Cars needs battery

The Hershey Company

Exchange - Listed on both NYSE and NASDAQ

Ticker Symbol - HSY

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

Based on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth.",29,0,0.99431795,Market Volatility,0.9858,positive,Bearish,"ON, HSY, FOR, DO, HOOD, BE, FOR, BY, BY, ARE, NOW, ARE, AN, ONTO, ON, ARE, AN, FOR, ARE, NOW, ON, LOW, LOW, LOW, LOW, ON, BE, GOOD, NOW, ARE, SEE, IT, AN, HAS, FOR, NDAQ"
