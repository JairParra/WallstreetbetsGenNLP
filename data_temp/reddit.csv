I own shares and bought some $10 options expiring in June. 

Why? 

Have you seen the Bird Flu? 

Ok now stay with me here. Before we get to tin foil hat predictions and whatnot, letâ€™s just talk about whatâ€™s going on. Bird Flu has been found in beef, eggs, and chicken (yeah technically the same thing but the actual birds not just the eggs you feel me?) - also, someone in Texas has tested positive for it.

In the past few days the mainstream media has begun reporting on the Bird Flu. The European CDC has issued a statement about how itâ€™s dangerous. 

Hypothetically, letâ€™s say pandemic 2.0 rolls around. In this one your food will not be safe. People will be scared their chicken, eggs, and beef - maybe more animals down the line - may have the virus. 

Insert - $BYND - yes, beyond your wildest imagination, you can have meatless meat. You think soy and that other vegan shit can catch viruses? Nope. This will be like the toilet paper rush in the early covid days. Everyone will hoard the virus-safe meat. 

Rocket is being gassed, hop on while you can ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

TLDR: sick birds make vegan tendies"

DD: SGML seems a solid earner,1,1bw5ym0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bw5ym0/dd_sgml_seems_a_solid_earner/,6,1712282164.0,2024-04-05 01:56:04,"DD: SGML seems a solid earner

Right so here's the idea.

SGML, is Sigma Lithium. They just announced after earnings that they are looking to double production. Construction begins this month. They already have the capital required to get it built.

What do they make? EV batteries. Who drives places? Everybody. It's simple. Cars don't work without batteries. Tesla just got rocked by that Chinese company who is selling their cars cheaper. Maybe they've got a better battery supplier. Maybe it's SGML. Maybe not but who knows.

Either way, gains.

To recap:

- Being a sigma is fuckin cool

- Lithium

- Cars needs battery

The Hershey Company

Exchange - Listed on both NYSE and NASDAQ

Ticker Symbol - HSY

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

Based on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth."
