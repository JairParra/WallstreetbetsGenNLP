"Institutions already know PCE data one month before you, and the Report is already priced in by the time it drops - here's your proof",307,1bqth2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqth2o/institutions_already_know_pce_data_one_month/,103,1711729631.0,2024-03-29 16:27:11,"Institutions already know PCE data one month before you, and the Report is already priced in by the time it drops - here's your proof

Too many lil dipshits telling me I'm crazy for having this theory, so I took the time to break it down for those mongoloids.

We do not see the PCE report for the prior month until the end of the current month. On March 29, we only just now see February's PCE, but it is the end of March, and that subsequent report will already be just about finished. Institutions get to see those numbers weeks before us.

Here's your proof:

From July 28, 2023 through October 27, 2023, SPY dropped -$40.

From June 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, PCE stopped declining and ramped up hot at 3.198% to 3.37% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))

Keep those dates in mind, and follow along with daddy:

From May 2023 through June 2023, PCE DROPPED 3.96% to 3.19%. The June DROPPED PCE rate would have released to the public on July 28, 2023. This is precisely when SPY began bleeding out. At that time the bleeding began, it would have looked to Retail as though PCE was still cooling. However, at the time June PCE was being released to the public, July data was already in existence, and the July data was going to show that PCE was no longer cooling, and in fact was rising again.

You still with me? Let's fast-forward to the most recent climb, which began on October 26, 2023, which has preceded this most recent vertical line up.

On October 27, 2023, Retail was just getting the released September PCE readings. ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01))

As you may recall, September's PCE readings were STILL GOING UP. On October 27, 2023, the public would still be seeing a rise in PCE. However, weirdly, the market began shooting up.

Guess why...

Because the October data showed PCE significantly cooled from 3.37% to 2.95% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))

Weirdly, this cooling data from October was not available to the public until November 30, 2023, at which point SPY had already rebounded from $410 to $450.

&#x200B;

That's all. This isn't a conspiracy you clowns, this is real.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr, SPY price movements correlate perfectly with UNRELEASED PCE data, and contradicts the released data.

My fellow degenerates/apes, \*\*\*KingKong's here, I don't like shit talk, as talk is cheap, that's why you seldom see my comment /post here. But when I move, it is going to be WOW. Overcoming/ignoring the FUDders, mockers, and shit-talkers, my conviction on stock DJT has paid off, with a realized net gain of $1.2 million over the last 3 days.   
How I did it: Like you, I was searching for a rocket that could bring me to the moon ( like some of you, I jumped on the wrong rocket and it crashed on Earth miserably) During Covid plandemic, I was awakened to the reality of the lying mainstream media, censoring big techs, corrupt political establishments, evil globalists, deep state swamps and came to conclusion and conviction that Trump and his company TMTG are the antidotes. I started accumulating its stocks, and then its warrants, when I anticipated the catalytic events, especially this DWAC and TMTG merger on 03/26/24,  I loaded up its call options;  I have taken profit of about half of my portfolio and will continue to accumulate DJT when it dips, as the journey to the moon is just at the beginning, can you imagine where this rocket DJT will reach when Trump becomes the president of the United States again, the most powerful man on earth?   
​\*\*\*Disclaimer : this is not financial advice, it is just my experience and journey of awakening.

YIKES!! I don't really want to make any bold claims here, but.... here we go.

DJT is a very volatile tech stock that is currently not profitable.  I think A LOT of the short term gain its had is due to speculation and irrational buyers.

At some point the hype will cool off and it will drop in price due to its poor fundamentals as a company.  Be careful with this stock guys! I don't think its a safe long term investment!!!!

I know this is kind of SHOCKING and is going to rock the boat here, but yeah, I said it.  Downvote me if you must!

ARTICLE TLDR:  Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

So, since Bloomberg reported that iPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, and if we would look on the overall Apple history in China, do they have any prospects there?

Firstly, Tim had some issues in China even in 2018 (the first great revenue decline), but let's say Apple [resolved it](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement). Secondly, Xiaomi released their EVs, which was Apple dream for years, but eventually failed.

Personally I think that China could be great opportunity for Apple but since China is really problematic market for the US in general, I'm just wondering when Apple would leave it at all?

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell repeated that the US central bank isn’t in any rush to cut interest rates as policymakers await more evidence that inflation is contained.

“The fact that the US economy is growing at such a solid pace, the fact that the labor market is still very, very strong, gives us the chance to just be a little more confident about inflation coming down before we take the important step of cutting rates,” Powell said Friday at an event at the San Francisco Fed.
