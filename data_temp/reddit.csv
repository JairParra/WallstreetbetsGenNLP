Ok here‚Äôs the deal.  We all remember the hype when Canada legalized.  Everyone thought it was the ultimate infinite money glitch.

And for a while, based on the hype, it was.  Canada was the first major first world country to outright legalize (sorry Netherlands your half measures are no good for stonks), and the outlook was looking good for US legalization.  We had a boomer Republican president in the US at the time, but one who was decidedly less hostile to Marijuana than the typical boomer Republican.  Speaking of boomers‚Ä¶their parents who grew up watching reefer madness and blamed all crime on Mexican reefer addicts and always voted 98% no to any loosening of marijuana laws were finally starting to fucking die.  No one under 40 still thought it should be illegal and the national pulse had finally turned in favor of legalizing nationwide in the US.  Everyone saw it coming imminently.

But Canada is a nation of 38 million.  Barely a single major city in the US.  Not nearly enough to justify the size and scope of the weed market that emerged.  The stonks soared.  I remember ACB at 200 times it‚Äôs current price.

But it slowly dawned that no, in fact, America wasn‚Äôt going to reschedule, let alone legalize.  There wasn‚Äôt going to be a big enough market to support all the infrastructure the Canadian firms invested in.  The stocks cratered and a lot of degenerates lost a lot of money.

Then Biden, a democrat, gets elected‚Ä¶.the democrats being the party who overwhelmingly support legalization, it stood to reason that a liberalization of American marijuana law was imminent and again the stocks popped, though nowhere near the 2019 highs.  This is where I jumped in (MJ ETF, ACB and OGI)‚Ä¶and again, it slowly dawned that US legalization was going nowhere‚Ä¶and again the stocks slowly waned, punctuated occasionally by big pops on irrelevant news like another state legalizing‚Ä¶each time I thought this was it, this time it turns around for good.

I lost like 75% before giving up and selling my shares, and good thing I did, because I‚Äôd have lost another 75% had I sat on it.

Now Germany just legalized and again the stocks are popping and a lot of us can‚Äôt see past these old painful memories.  I get it.

Just hear me out.

Now keep in mind right off the bat Germany is a much bigger nation and economy than Canada (>2X the population and 1.25x the GDP, roughly).  It alone can support a much larger market than Canada.  So the pop in weed stocks we‚Äôve seen now is already justified and yet they still have tremendous upside.

But my fellow regards, this is just the warmup round.

Joe Brandon is in trouble.  He‚Äôs behind in the polls, he‚Äôs seen as old, stuffy and senile.  His oldness, stuffiness and senility are perfectly encapsulated by his antiquated commitment to continuing marijuana prohibition.  It‚Äôs worth noting that he is the leader of a party that abandoned its commitment to marijuana prohibition decades ago and while he‚Äôs stubbornly been clinging to it more and more of the old fuddie duddie hardliners have died and almost no one in the country still supports continuing prohibition.  Certainly almost no democrats.  Also, RFK is running as an independent and he has confirmed he will make marijuana legalization a priority.  While RFK will be pulling support from trump too (think Covid hoaxery) I am convinced he‚Äôll be pulling harder from Brandon.

Brandon needs something big to revitalize his campaign, and he‚Äôs been dropping hints that marijuana very well could be that thing.  April is ‚Äúsecond chance month‚Äù and this year he went further than before in his commentary on the topic, suggesting rescheduling and/or hinting at legalization.  Kamala Harris has been pressuring the DEA to take action now.  Things are happening that are unlike anything from 2019 or 2021.  Traditionally 4/20 is associated with marijuana and the bettor in me senses something big may be coming this month, possibly on or around that day.

Yes, marijuana stocks are up somewhat on German legalization, but still down well over 90 to 95% or more from the 2019 highs.

I‚Äôm not saying YOLO on weed calls.  But picking up some shares right now is a relatively low risk (the stocks are already so so so far downbeaten with residual pessimism) move with tremendous potential upside.

TLDR; buy weed stonks before 4/20

Position (edited to reflect additions since OP): 5,000 Tilray in at 2.41.  2,000 SNDL at 2.40.  500 ACB at 6.90.  800 CURLF at 5.45.  500 CGC at 9.55.  No options (NB4 ‚Äòif you really believes in your DD you‚Äôd YOLO your life savings into calls‚Äô, I‚Äôm 40 years old and have 4 kids, I can‚Äôt afford the risk.  I don‚Äôt fuck with options, ever).

I‚Äôve read some DDs on here that convince me Tilray is the strongest play.  Pick whatever suits you.

Nothing has changed fundamentally for BA in last month and the selling is not done yet.  I have been watching the tape for last several months and it pulls back a little bit when news is slow or when they tease something a little bit positive, but then goes back flat.  It's a buy long term, but selling has to wind down first, which won't happen till the next set of heavy news cycle from the upcoming hearings and results.  Sit on this for next month or so, but keep an eye, once it breaks out, Boeing is gonna be hitting $230 (medium term) and $350 within 12-14 months."

AAPL is about to make a monster comeback üöÄ

Yeah their car and streaming bets flopped, but the Apple bears counting them out are missing one thing - Cupertino is going back to its roots: kicking ass in computers and chips.

Just look at what they did with M1. Apple's silicon plays are insane. You really think they won't leverage that into servers and AI in a massive way?

The narrative is AAPL has lost its mojo. That's exactly when they strike. I've been loading the dip under $175. 

Mark my words:

* $210 by WWDC in June when they flex the new compute/AI roadmap
* $300 within 12 months as the AI server ramp kicks into higher gear

Don't underestimate Apple when they get lean and refocus on the core markets they dominated for decades. A $3T comeback arc is brewing.

Consensus is they are defending, but I suspect they will make a play for the DC dollars.  

Buying every dip."

The obvious top play is $MU (Micron). 

This bad boy was overlooked while everyone stared at AI. The part that made it juicy is that it's a supportive play for AI. As those processors crunch bytes at amazing speeds, that data needs to come from somewhere and go somewhere else.

Storage is the big play here. 

They've almost sold out the next 2 years with locked in prices and deposits paid up front. There won't be any layoffs for the 43,000 full time employees. There's also a good chance they expand operations and go on a hiring spree.

You'll see some wild price swings as shorts do everything they can to get the f\*ck out of this one before shit really gets crazy.

Short term estimate: $200+ before settling down around $180 in the next 6 months.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up are $SPY and $IVV.

You can't really go wrong on this one. When the top holdings are mostly tech companies and Buffett uses it to win bets, arrogant shorts tend to get a little crazy and overstep their bounds quite often.

This is the mac daddy of ETF's and can't possibly lose in the long run.

If a stock performs poorly, it gets kicked to the curb and a new one gets introduced.

Right now though, in relation to shorts mistaking this for the year 1999, they've put themselves in a precarious position once again as tech companies actually have a plan this time.

Short term estimate: $530 by end of next week

Long term (EOY): $600+

A twin to this is $IVV. 

iShares Core S&P 500 ETF 

The holdings are the same as $SPY and will move in lock-step.

If one goes up or down, the other will do the same.

Here's a comparison of the 2:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/icv5sbuz4bsc1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5282af98c78843273eb97506b7749b25552f8d5

Price Estimate: Same as $SPY

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next play is $NVDA.

With new partnerships, sales and hype daily, shorts have completely f\*cked themselves on this one with nowhere to run. Averaging up is their only play because they aren't smart enough to take the loss.

I would say there's been enough information posted about them on here, so I'll cut this short and show you their current dark pool short position of $-97,038,220,000:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yfmgio9v5bsc1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc9a636756bf7dba6b0714898d23e53fb63f372

When this blows (very shortly), you're looking at an easy target of $1,400-$1,500 before settling in to $1,300 after the tears of Hedge Funds fill the streets.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up is $AMD.

Again, it comes up a lot in this sub but there's a few key things that don't.

The short position is over extended but most importantly, the recent hire of Thomas Zacharia is a bigger deal than people realize. 

He came from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In his 35 years there, he worked with industry leaders in tech, government, businesses and military.

By businesses, I'm not talking about Walmart. I mean the ones who design and build infrastructure.

‚ÄúThomas is a distinguished leader with decades of experience successfully creating public/private partnerships that have resulted in consistently deploying the world‚Äôs most powerful and advanced computing solutions, including the world‚Äôs fastest supercomputer Frontier‚Äù 

That quote alone, says a lot.

Not only can he call up the CEO of companies and world leaders, they'll answer the phone. The man has the world at his fingertips and now has AMD at his disposal.

Working at Oak Ridge would've been loaded with babysitting as they're responsible for the production of nuclear isotopes and funded by the Department of Energy.

Once this guy settles in, opens up his Rolodex, realizes his new found freedom, AMD will be well on its way.

Short term target (caused by a short explosion): $275

Long term with a solid dividend: $250 followed by a steady rise.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two that I'm grouping together are Joby Aviation (JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR). There are others but their market caps are too small at this point.

eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing*)* companies are going to be huge once they take off. 

&#x200B;

[Joby eVTOL](https://preview.redd.it/0xgynyxqhbsc1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e243094f0665f3d1a8cf7b17a69d40a7ec2e28a)

They won't be taking off until early 2025 and the earliest. This is due to FAA approval on what is a brand new technology that's about to hit the skies.

The appeal of this play is that these methods of travel are more nimble in urban environments than helicopters and cars.

Without the need for a runway, waiting at a gate and sniffing farts, you can be lifted straight into the air, skip over the city and be set down at your destination. 

This obviously won't be what the everyday citizen is using as a method of transportation. This will be bank executives, hedge fund managers, CEO's and politicians that need to move quickly. 

Other possible use cases are news channels that want to report on the traffic, weather and car chases. Police and emergency E-vac are definitely possibilities as well.

Both companies have already made deliveries to military installations and plan to deliver more. Think of the scene in Avatar when the Na'vi home gets obliterated.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z4denis5ebsc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=3470e228f7d1a0f2fcad3b3b33a719b75d4bc3b0

With their current ranges of a couple hundred miles at a couple hundred miles and hour, they're perfect for city environments and short range operations. With the added benefit of being fully electric and quiet, they'll come with a much higher acceptance than you're current helicopter.

Here's the one thing that should be seriously noted on these:

# THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY!

As noted above, they can't make any income from sales until they receive FAA approval.

They're currently on stage 4 of 5. 

(1) certification basis

(2) planning and standards

(3) analysis and testing 

(4)  final decision and certification of design 

(5)  Showing and Verifying where the results of the testing are verified by the FAA. Upon successful completion of this stage, a type certification is issued. 

If the stock jumps at all before Q1, 2025, it will be hype at best and not hold. If you want to get in early, all good but you should be planning to have that cash tied up for a while.

With Toyota backing Joby and Daimler backing Archer, you know that these two (and others) have what they need to make this a reality.

Short term target: Nothing meaningful

Long term target: Only up

&#x200B;

I have OTM calls in most of the above plays. Nothing all that spectacular as I'm currently poor. This will change as the above list starts paying off.

I also have a Youtube channel where I hunt these down, show how I did it and call them out.

Rule 13 prevents linking it.

I'll have another list for you tomorrow. I'll limit these posts to 5 stocks per day moving forward so they're more in depth as ""currently unknown"" tickers come up."
